## To Run

The application is run with two separate "runnable" apps - the SiloHost (Orleans Server) and the Client.  Both of these are console apps and can be run with a similar command:

* From "/src/Kritner.OrleansGettingStarted.SiloHost/" run `dotnet run`.
* from "/src/Kritner.OrleansGettingStarted.Client" run `dotnet run`.
